    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every pass play has a combination of routes. Determining each player's route could allow the defense to adjust coverage and also allow the defenders to adjust which way they force the route runner. Both reactions by the defense are an attempt to minimize the number of yards gained by the offense. Doing all of this in less than 40 seconds while players substitute and the offense shifts and motions can make it difficult for a defender to determine which route the receivers might run. Predicting the routes for each route runner can allow defenders to make decisions on the fly and increase their chance of either generating incompletions or interceptions. Defenses should look to generate incompletions and interceptions because the data suggests that these outcomes reduce the probability of the offense scoring. <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/EPADist.png\" style=\"width: 600px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be beneficial for defenses to know when deeper routes are being ran because deeper routes increase the chance of scoring for the offense more than shorter routes on average. The below figure gives evidence that there is a moderate positive relationship between the average depth of target and EPA/Pass. <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/RouteEPA.png\" style=\"width: 600px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This research provides a machine learning model that can be used to predict the route for each route runner on a play. Defenders can use important features from this model to key in on different aspects of a play which will make it easier for the defender to understand which routes will be ran. Additionally, offenses can use these predictions for self-scouting to determine how predictable they are being. This paper will walk through the process of building the model as well as what may be gleaned from the results."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This research uses tracking, play-by-play, route runner, and game data from weeks 1-9 of the 2022 season. The data was filtered to remove post-snap information, run plays, and non-route runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizations were added to the dataset to enhance the performance of the model. The offensive formation, receiver alignment, and route runner's team were one-hot encoded to add context about tendancies. For example, shotgun formations are more likely to lead to GO routes while under center formations are more likely to lead to FLAT and CROSS routes. <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/RouteRateByFormation.png\" style=\"width: 1000px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the distance from the route runner to the other 10 offensive players was added to give context about the setup of the formation. In the below example, there is evidence that there is a positive relationship between predictability and distance to the closest offensive player. As players move away from the closest offensive player, they are more likely to run either a HITCH or GO route while players lining up near another offensive player have a more diverse route tree.  <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/RouteRateByDistToNearestOff.png\" style=\"width: 1000px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature that was added to the dataset was the route runner's distance to the line of scrimmage. There is evidence that route runners lined up closer to the line of scrimmage will run GO and HITCH routes while players lined up in the backfield will run more FLAT and ANGLE routes. This is likely because route runners closer to the line of scrimmage are wide receivers while those further away from the line of scrimmage are running backs. Rather than using the player's position on the depth chart, the player's distance to the line of scrimmage will be used in case a wide receiver was lined up in the backfield or a running back motioned out wide. <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/RouteRateByYdsToLOS.png\" style=\"width: 1000px\"/></center>"

    "# Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Two multilayer perceptron neural networks were trained to generate the route predictions, one for shotgun formations and the other for under center formations. While one model was initially trained, splitting the dataset into the two types of formations led to better F1 scores on unseen data. The best performing models had 86 input features, 30 nodes in the first hidden layer, 20 nodes in the second hidden layer, and 13 nodes in the output layer, one node for each possible route. The 86 input features include the route runner's coordinates, direction, and speed as well as features for the distance to each offensive player, quarter, seconds remaining in the half, down, distance, presnap possession team win probability, distance to the line of scrimmage, formation, receiver alignment, and team of the route runner. The training set consisted of weeks 1-7 while the test set used weeks 8 and 9."

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature importance scores were created for the model by shuffling the values of one feature for the model, generating new predictions, calculating the difference between the new score and the original score, and resetting the dataset to the original data. This process was repeated ten times for each feature and an average differnce was calculated to determine the feature's importance. The average differences were sorted in descending order to find the most important features. The following figure shows the top 10 important features for both models. Distance to the line of scrimmage is the most important feature because players that lined up in the backfield were more likely to run FLAT routes while players lined up on the line of scrimmage were more likely to run GO and HITCH routes. Additionally, players that were lined up close to the 3 nearest offensive players had a diverse route tree while those futher away primarily ran GO and HITCH routes. <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/featureImportance.png\" style=\"width: 1200px\"/></center>\n",

    "## Team/Player Predictability\n",
    "\n",
    "From the predictions made by the model, there is evidence that there is a moderate negative relationship between offensive predictability and offensive efficiency. Therefore, teams could use this model to determine if they are being predictable and improve their efficiency by reducing their predictability.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/teamPredictabilityVsEPAPass.png\" style=\"width: 600px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can learn that players who want to be more efficient should be willing to diversify their route tree and location at the time of the snap because there is evidence that there is a negative relationship between player predictability and EPA/Reception. Additionally, defenses could use features from this model to help their defensive backs determine which route their man is going to run. By having a better understanding of the route that is about to be ran, the defensive backs can minimize the effectiveness of their man's route.\n",

    "## Play Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example illustrates how the model works throughout the presnap process. The table to the right of the animation provides the predictions for each player in each frame with the probability that each player runs the predicted route. From this, we can see how important the player's distance from the line of scrimmage is as both players in the backfield are predicted to run FLAT routes. It's also important to note that both receivers are the lone receiver on their side of the formation; therefore, this leads the model to predict GO routes for them. <center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattflaherty97/BDB2025/refs/heads/main/visuals/samplePlay.gif\" style=\"width: 200\"/></center>\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams can use this analysis in preparation for the upcoming week both offensively and defensively. Offensively, teams could look back on how predictable they have been up until the current week and look to change their patterns. This research has shown that there are benefits from being unpredictable with routes. Defensively, teams could use important features in this model like distance of the route runner to the line of scrimmage and distance to the other receivers to find tendencies in receiver alignment and formation of their upcoming opponent. This research gives evidence that the more predictable you can make a team, the less efficent they will be."
